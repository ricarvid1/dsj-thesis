The stacked {WSS} module can be configured in different ways for application at either the transit side or the add/drop side of a colorless, directionless, and contentionless ({CDC}) reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer ({ROADM}). Two {ROADM} architectures are proposed based on the stacked {WSS} modules. Their costs are analyzed for both a 4-deg network node and a larger 8-deg node. The first proposed {ROADM} architecture with full {CDC} features is shown to realize a cost reduction of at least 35\% in these two test network nodes, when compared with the conventional {CDC} {ROADM} architecture based on the standalone {WSSs} and multicasting switches ({MCSs}). The second {ROADM} architecture proposed has a small probability of wavelength contention, which could be prevented by a local wavelength assignment algorithm. According to our cost estimation, we are able to aggressively reduce the number of components at the add/drop side and make an overall cost reduction of {\textgreater}70\% and {\textgreater}80\% in the 4- and 8-deg network nodes, respectively.},

The current, standard design for universal multiport interferometers is based on work by Reck et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 58, 1994).

In this paper, we review the state of the art of general-purpose waveguide mesh arrangements with a special focus on those that allow the synthesis of optical feedback loops. Moreover, we propose for the first time, a new design approach to generate waveguide mesh patterns with equally-oriented components. This innovation is of special relevance to improve performance and to mitigate one of the main scalability limitations, the integration density. The paper finalizes with an introduction to control algorithms for waveguide mesh arrangements based on derivative methods and non-derivative methods. These control methods provide a proof for the self-reconfiguration of large-scale waveguide mesh arrangements. In particular, we apply the computational optimization algorithms to program a hexagonal waveguide mesh to emulate a 1 × 8 beamforming network and an optical filter based on an unbalanced {MZI} design. All in all, the paper comprises recipes to achieve truly practical software-defined photonic integrated circuits.},

Compared to the triangular (Reck) mesh, our proposed diamond mesh makes use of a larger number of {MZIs}, leading to a symmetric topology and adding additional degrees of freedom for the weight matrix optimization in the backpropagation process. Furthermore, the additional {MZIs} enable the diamond mesh to optimally eliminate the excess light intensity that degrades the performance of the {ONNs} through the tapered out waveguides. Our results show that the diamond topology is more robust to the inevitable imperfections in practice, i.e., insertion loss of the constituent {MZIs} and the phase errors. This robustness allows for better classification accuracy in the presence of experimental imperfections. The practical performance and the scalability of the two structures implementing different sizes of optical neural networks are analytically compared. The obtained results confirm that the diamond mesh is more error-and loss-tolerant in classifying the data samples in different sizes of {ONNs}.},

Significant effort has been made towards developing electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that exhibit improved computational speed and accuracy. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully optical neural network that, in principle, could offer an enhancement in computational speed and power efficiency over state-of-the-art electronics for conventional inference tasks.

	abstract = {Universal multiport photonic interferometers that can implement any arbitrary unitary transformation between input and output optical modes are essential to support advanced optical functions. Integrated versions of these components can be implemented by means of either a fixed triangular or a fixed rectangular arrangement of the same components. We propose the implementation of a fixed rectangular universal interferometer using a reconfigurable hexagonal waveguide mesh circuit. A suitable adaptation synthesis algorithm tailored to this mesh configuration is provided and the experimental demonstration of a rectangular multiport interferometer by means of a fabricated silicon photonics chip is reported. The 7-hexagonal cell chip can implement 2 × 2, 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 arbitrary unitary transformations. The proposed hexagonal waveguide mesh operates in a similar way as a Field Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA}) in electronics. We believe that this work represents an important step-forward towards fully programmable and integrable multiport interferometers.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a coherent multiple-input multiple-output ({MIMO}) radar system with widely separated antennas is simulated in three-dimensional (3D) surveillance scenarios. This analysis proceeds in parallel with the design and development of a system demonstrator based on photonic technology. Microwave photonics permits to conceive an architecture where all radar signals are coherently generated and received in a photonics-based central unit and optically distributed/collected to/from the radar heads where antennas are located, through optical fiber links, maintaining the coherence. Albeit centralized coherent data fusion becomes possible, preliminary results show how secondary lobes represent the major limiting factor for the radar's performance. Nonetheless, diversity in the spatial and/or frequency domains become a crucial resource to circumvent this problem. A {MIMO} radar simulator is proposed to estimate the coherent ambiguity function in 3D multi-target multi-band scenarios. Preliminary simulation results, concerning 3D scenarios considered of high interest for automotive and other applications, show that coherence in {MIMO} systems allows to achieve an angular and height resolution very close to the theoretical limit given by the used {RF} wavelength and baseline length, thus confirming the huge potential of coherent {MIMO} radars in 3D applications.},

The linear transformation matrix of the structure is theoretically determined using its building block, which is a 2 × 2 reconfigurable {MZI}. To program the device, the linear transformation matrix of a given application is decomposed into that of the constituent {MZIs} of the structure. Thus, the required phase shifts for implementing the transformation matrix of the application by means of the optical processor are determined theoretically. Due to random phase offsets in the {MZIs} resulting from fabrication process variations, they are initially configured through an experimental protocol. The presented calibration scheme allows to straightforwardly characterize the {MZIs} to mitigate the possible input phase errors and determine the bar and cross states of each {MZI} for tuning it at the required sate before programming the device. After the configuration process, the device can be programmed to construct the linear transformation matrix of the application. In this regard, using the required bias voltages, the phase shifts obtained from the decomposition process are applied to the phase shifters of the {MZIs} in the device.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of ultrahigh-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence ({AI})1, the world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data that need to be processed in a fast and efficient way. Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important2. Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (1012 {MAC} operations per second or tera-{MACs} per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit ({ASIC}). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates3–5, ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides6,7, and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor ({CMOS}) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy {AI} applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services. An integrated photonic processor, based on phase-change-material memory arrays and chip-based optical frequency combs, which can operate at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate ({MAC}) operations per second, is demonstrated.},

While state-of-the-art {PSNN} designs require a continuous laser pump, this paper presents a monolithic optoelectronic {PSNN} hardware design consisting of an {MZI} mesh incoherent network and event-driven laser spiking neurons. We designed, prototyped, and experimentally demonstrated this event-driven neuron inspired by the Izhikevich model incorporating both excitatory and inhibitory optical spiking inputs and producing optical spiking outputs accordingly. The optoelectronic neurons consist of two photodetectors for excitatory and inhibitory optical spiking inputs, electrical transistors\&\#x2019; circuits providing spiking nonlinearity, and a laser for optical spiking outputs. Additional inclusion of capacitors and resistors complete the Izhikevich-inspired optoelectronic neurons, which receive excitatory and inhibitory optical spikes as inputs from other optoelectronic neurons. We developed a detailed optoelectronic neuron model in Verilog-A and simulated the circuit-level operation of various cases with excitatory input and inhibitory input signals. The experimental results closely resemble the simulated results and demonstrate how the excitatory inputs trigger the optical spiking outputs while the inhibitory inputs suppress the outputs. The nanoscale neuron designed in our monolithic {PSNN} utilizes quantum impedance conversion. It shows that estimated 21.09 {fJ}/spike input can trigger the output from on-chip nanolasers running at a maximum of 10 Gspike/second in the neural network. Utilizing the simulated neuron model, we conducted simulations on {MNIST} handwritten digits recognition using fully connected ({FC}) and convolutional neural networks ({CNN}). The simulation results show 90\&\#x0025; accuracy on unsupervised learning and 97\&\#x0025; accuracy on a supervised modified {FC} neural network. The benchmark shows our {PSNN} can achieve 50 {TOP}/J energy efficiency, which corresponds to 100\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;throughputs and 1000\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;energy-efficiency improvements compared to state-of-art electrical neuromorphic hardware such as Loihi and {NeuroGrid}.},

We also show how the device can configure itself progressively, avoiding design calculations and allowing the device to stabilize itself against drifts in component properties and to continually adjust itself to changing conditions. This self-configuration operates by training with the desired pairs of orthogonal input and output functions, using sets of detectors and local feedback loops to set individual optical elements within the device, with no global feedback or multiparameter optimization required. Simple mappings, such as spatial mode conversions and polarization control, can be implemented using standard planar integrated optics. In the spirit of a universal machine, we show that other linear operations, including frequency and time mappings, as well as nonreciprocal operation, are possible in principle, even if very challenging in practice, thus proving there is at least one constructive design for any conceivable linear optical component; such a universal device can also be self-configuring.

Present-day photonic quantum computers3–7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8. These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.},

In practice, the phase-shifters in a mesh photonic circuit must be calibrated to compensate for phase errors due to fabrication variations. Calibration using photodetectors external to the mesh has been demonstrated for triangular meshes, but not rectangular meshes. Here, we propose an algorithm for the calibration of rectangular meshes using only external photodetectors and simulate it to evaluate its feasibility.},

To date, each topological photonic platform implements a specific type of Hamiltonian with inexistent or limited reconfigurability. Here, we propose and demonstrate different topological models by using the same reprogrammable integrated photonics platform, consisting of a hexagonal mesh of silicon Mach-Zehnder interferometers with phase shifters. We specifically demonstrate a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian supporting a localized topological edge mode and a higher-order topological insulator based on a two-dimensional breathing Kagome Hamiltonian with three corner states. These results highlight a nearly universal platform for topological models that may fast-track research progress toward applications of topological photonics and other coupled systems.},

This advantage stems from the inherent suitability of optical signals to carry out matrix multiplication. However, even deterministic phenomena such as thermal crosstalk make precise programming of photonic chips a challenging task. Here, we train and experimentally evaluate three models incorporating varying degrees of physics intuition to predict the effect of thermal crosstalk in different locations of an integrated programmable photonic mesh. We quantify the effect of thermal crosstalk by the resonance wavelength shift in the power spectrum of a microring resonator implemented in the chip, achieving modelling errors {\textless} 0.5 pm. We experimentally validate the models through compensation of the crosstalk-induced wavelength shift. Finally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of one of the models by employing it to predict and compensate for the effect of thermal crosstalk for parts of the chip it was not trained on, revealing root-mean-square-errors of {\textless} 2.0 pm.},

Traditional experimental implementations need N2 units such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers ({MZIs}) for an input dimension N to realize typical computing operations (convolutions and matrix multiplication), resulting in limited scalability and consuming excessive power. Here, we propose the integrated diffractive optical network for implementing parallel Fourier transforms, convolution operations and application-specific optical computing using two ultracompact diffractive cells (Fourier transform operation) and only N {MZIs}. The footprint and energy consumption scales linearly with the input data dimension, instead of the quadratic scaling in the traditional {ONN} framework. A {\textasciitilde}10-fold reduction in both footprint and energy consumption, as well as equal high accuracy with previous {MZI}-based {ONNs} was experimentally achieved for computations performed on the {MNIST} and Fashion-{MNIST} datasets. The integrated diffractive optical network ({IDNN}) chip demonstrates a promising avenue towards scalable and low-power-consumption optical computational chips for optical-artificial-intelligence.},

This Perspective sheds light on the potential of free-space optical systems based on engineered surfaces for advancing optical computing. Manipulating light in unprecedented ways, emerging structured surfaces enable all-optical implementation of various mathematical functions and machine learning tasks. Diffractive networks, in particular, bring deep-learning principles into the design and operation of free-space optical systems to create new functionalities. Metasurfaces consisting of deeply subwavelength units are achieving exotic optical responses that provide independent control over different properties of light and can bring major advances in computational throughput and data-transfer bandwidth of free-space optical processors. Unlike integrated photonics-based optoelectronic systems that demand preprocessed inputs, free-space optical processors have direct access to all the optical degrees of freedom that carry information about an input scene/object without needing digital recovery or preprocessing of information. To realize the full potential of free-space optical computing architectures, diffractive surfaces and metasurfaces need to advance symbiotically and co-evolve in their designs, 3D fabrication/integration, cascadability, and computing accuracy to serve the needs of next-generation machine vision, computational imaging, mathematical computing, and telecommunication technologies.},

	abstract = {Most modern computing tasks have digital electronic input and output data. Due to these constraints imposed by real-world use cases of computer systems, any analog computing accelerator, whether analog electronic or optical, must perform an analog-to-digital conversion on its input data and a subsequent digital-to-analog conversion on its output data. The energy and latency costs incurred by data conversion place performance limits on analog computing accelerators. To avoid this overhead, analog hardware must replace the full functionality of traditional digital electronic computer hardware. This is not currently possible for optical computing accelerators due to limitations in gain, input-output isolation, and information storage in optical hardware. This article presents a case study that profiles 27 benchmarks for an analog optical Fourier transform and convolution accelerator which we designed and built. The case study shows that an ideal optical Fourier transform and convolution accelerator can produce an average speedup of 9.4× and a median speedup of 1.9× for the set of benchmarks. The optical Fourier transform and convolution accelerator only produces significant speedup for pure Fourier transform (45.3×) and convolution (159.4×) applications.},

The text presents the information concisely yet completely, discussing in detail all indispensable features of the {VHDL} synthesis. The book is organised in a clear progression, with the first part covering the circuit level, treating foundations of {VHDL} and fundamental coding, and the second part covering the system level (units that might be located in a library for code sharing, reuse and partitioning), expanding upon the earlier chapters to discuss system coding. techniques of {VHDL}, including code structure, data types, operators and attributes, concurrent and sequential statements and code, objects (signals, variables and constants), design of finite state machines and examples of additional circuit designs. Part {II}, System Design, builds on the material already presented, adding elements intended mainly for library allocation; it examines packages and components, functions and procedures and additional examples of system design. Appendixes on programmable logic devices ({PLDs}/{FPGAs}) and synthesis tools follow Part {II}.

The results are highly encouraging. Within our framework, we are able to solve the following types of problems: 1) To find a path between two points so that it crosses the least number of existing paths. 2) To find a path between two points so that it avoids as much as possible preset obstacles such as edges. 3) To find a path between two points so that the path is optimal with respect to several properties; for example, a path which is not only one of those which cross the fewest number of existing paths, but, among these, is also one of the shortest. The minimal-distance solution has been programmed on an {IBM} 704 computer, and a number of illustrations are presented. The class of problems solvable by our algorithm is given in a theorem in Section {III}. A byproduct of this algorithm is a somewhat remote, but unexpected, relation to physical optics.

Application-specific photonic integrated circuits, where particular circuits/chips are designed to optimally perform particular functionalities, require a considerable number of design and fabrication iterations leading to long development times. A different approach inspired by electronic Field Programmable Gate Arrays is the programmable photonic processor, where a common hardware implemented by a two-dimensional photonic waveguide mesh realizes different functionalities through programming. Here, we report the demonstration of such reconfigurable waveguide mesh in silicon. We demonstrate over 20 different functionalities with a simple seven hexagonal cell structure, which can be applied to different fields including communications, chemical and biomedical sensing, signal processing, multiprocessor networks, and quantum information systems. Our work is an important step toward this paradigm.},

Relying on a common hardware implemented by two-dimensional integrated photonic waveguide meshes, they can provide multiple functionalities by suitable programming of their control signals. Scalability, which is essential for increasing functional complexity and integration density, is currently limited by the need to precisely control and configure several hundreds of variables and simultaneously manage multiple configuration actions. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate two different approaches towards management automation in programmable integrated photonic circuits. These enable the simultaneous handling of circuit self-characterization, auto-routing, self-configuration and optimization.

	abstract = {This book provides the first comprehensive, up-to-date and self-contained introduction to the emergent field of Programmable Integrated Photonics ({PIP}). It covers both theoretical and practical aspects, ranging from basic technologies and the building of photonic component blocks, to design alternatives and principles of complex programmable photonic circuits, their limiting factors, techniques for characterization and performance monitoring/control, and their salient applications both in the classical as well as in the quantum information fields. The book concentrates and focuses mainly on the distinctive features of programmable photonics, as compared to more traditional {ASPIC} approaches. After some years during which the Application Specific Photonic Integrated Circuit ({ASPIC}) paradigm completely dominated the field of integrated optics, there has been an increasing interest in {PIP}. The rising interest in {PIP} is justified by the surge in a number of emerging applications that call for true flexibility and reconfigurability, as well as low-cost, compact, and low-power consuming devices. Programmable Integrated Photonics is a new paradigm that aims at designing common integrated optical hardware configurations, which by suitable programming, can implement a variety of functionalities. These in turn can be exploited as basic operations in many application fields. Programmability enables, by means of external control signals, both chip reconfiguration for multifunction operation, as well as chip stabilization against non-ideal operations due to fluctuations in environmental conditions and fabrication errors. Programming also allows for the activation of parts of the chip, which are not essential for the implementation of a given functionality, but can be of help in reducing noise levels through the diversion of undesired reflections.},

By integrating high-performance filters into programmable microwave photonic processors, they can provide significant benefits for signal processing applications. The development of an algorithm that can automatically characterize and reconfigure the filter using a single optical input and output port is essential for this purpose. This paper presents an optimization technique for a fully tunable ring-assisted Mach–Zehnder interferometer filter. The proposed filter design eliminates the need for monitoring components and employs a novel algorithm that operates independently in each ring by switching between the two arms of the filter. In addition, the filter can be configured to implement different filter architectures, allowing for flexible filtering requirements. Measurements were performed using the device as an interleaver, implementing different types of infinite impulse response filters in the optical and radio frequency domains. Side-coupled integrated spaced sequence of resonator filters were also implemented by reconfiguring the same device. These results demonstrate the exceptional reconfigurability of the filter design proposed herein in terms of bandwidth and central frequency.},

However, data storage in these systems has been dominated by electronic memories which necessitates signal conversion between optical and electrical as well as analog and digital domains, and data movement between processor and memory that reduce the speed and energy efficiency. To date, a scalable optical memory with optical control has remained an open problem. Here we report an integrated photonic set-reset latch as a fundamental optical static memory unit based on universal optical logic gates. While the proposed memory is compatible with different photonic platforms, its functionality is demonstrated on a programmable silicon photonic chip as a proof of concept. Optical set, reset, and complementary outputs, scalability to a large number of memory units via the independent latch supply light, and compatibility with different photonic platforms enable more efficient and lower latency optical processing systems.},

Realizing the era of high-volume short-reach coherent links will require substantial improvements in transceiver cost and power efficiency, necessitating a reassessment of conventional architectures best-suited for longer-reach links and a review of assumptions for shorter-reach implementations. In this work, we analyze the impact of integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers ({SOAs}) on link performance and power consumption, and describe the optimal design spaces for low-cost and energy-efficient coherent links. Placing {SOAs} after the modulator provide the most energy-efficient link budget improvement, up to 6 {pJ}/bit for large link budgets, despite any penalties from nonlinear impairments. Increased robustness to {SOA} nonlinearities makes {QPSK}-based coherent links especially attractive, and larger supported link budgets enable the inclusion of optical switches, which could revolutionize data center networks and improve overall energy efficiency.},

This paper reports that the distortion is suppressed by setting the temperature of the ampliﬁer lower within the settable range, as a result of evaluating the temperature dependence of the distortion in optical ampliﬁcation with {SOAs} theoretically.},

We demonstrate a photonic integrated circuit–based erbium amplifier reaching 145 milliwatts of output power and more than 30 decibels of small-signal gain—on par with commercial fiber amplifiers and surpassing state-of-the-art {III}-V heterogeneously integrated semiconductor amplifiers. We apply ion implantation to ultralow–loss silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits, which are able to increase the soliton microcomb output power by 100 times, achieving power requirements for low-noise photonic microwave generation and wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications. Endowing Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits with gain enables the miniaturization of various fiber-based devices such as high–pulse-energy femtosecond mode-locked lasers.},

	abstract = {[{ES}] La fotónica de microondas, la cual une los mundos de la ingeniería de radiofrecuencia y la optoelectrónica, ha generado un gran interés en las últimas décadas. Su valor añadido se deriva del hecho de que, por un lado, permite la realización de funcionalidades clave en los sistemas de microondas que son complejas o directamente imposibles en el dominio de la radiofrecuencia. Por otro lado, crea nuevas oportunidades para los sistemas y redes de información y comunicación. Por lo tanto, la fotónica de microondas se utiliza para habilitar funciones especializadas como generación de señales de alta frecuencia, modulación, procesamiento de señales, particularmente en aplicaciones de comunicación, radar y detección. 
En el contexto de la fotónica programable, la versatilidad surge al permitir la manipulación dinámica de las señales de luz, haciéndolas adaptables para propósitos genéricos a través de redes ópticas, computación óptica, óptica adaptativa, investigación y desarrollo y fotónica cuántica. Por lo que, proporciona una plataforma flexible para aplicaciones ópticas, mostrando funciones complementarias a la tecnología fotónica moderna. 
 
Por lo tanto, los circuitos integrados fotónicos programables proponen y prometen ser una solución para competir con diseños específicos de aplicaciones. Sin embargo, las demostraciones actuales y las pruebas de concepto solo han integrado un número limitado de componentes y representan circuitos de complejidad pequeña y moderada. 
Este trabajo tiene como objetivo responder a las preguntas relacionadas con la escalabilidad del sistema y la evolución de futuros circuitos integrados fotónicos programables. El análisis y propuesta de soluciones constará de dos partes principales: la primera estudiará la escalabilidad de los circuitos programables en términos de integración de sistemas, incluyendo un estudio exhaustivo de las interfaces ópticas. En segundo lugar, debido a la necesidad de compensación de pérdidas que surge al utilizar fotónica integrada, consideraremos el rendimiento de modelos analíticos de fotónica de microondas de extremo a extremo con enlaces amplificados (balance de potencia óptica, ruido de señal, indicadores clave de rendimiento de enlaces fotónicos de microondas y consumo de energía). Una vez completado, utilizaremos diseños de complejidad moderada para evaluar nuestros estimadores de rendimiento tanto para el procesamiento de señales ópticas como para aplicaciones fotónicas de microondas.},

We fabricated a waveguide mesh on a chip with an effective area of 5.2m m×1.5m m, which contains six tunable basic units, and tested its performance. The extinction ratio of both output ports of the tunable basic units exceeded 15\&\#x00A0;{dB}, with P π=46m W and a response time of about 32\&\#x00A0;µs. By programming the waveguide mesh through a {PC}, it can be configured as a multi-channel adjustable optical switch, where the extinction ratio of each output port is greater than 15\&\#x00A0;{dB}.

The approach exploits splitting the input light into an array of multiple waveguides of different lengths that then feed a programmable interferometer array that can also self-configure. It can give spectral response similar to arrayed waveguide gratings but offers many other filtering functions, as well as supporting other structures based on non-redundant arrays for precise spectral filtering. Simultaneous filtering also allows, for the first time to our knowledge, an automatic measurement of the temporal coherency matrix and physical separation into the Karhunen-Lo{\textbackslash}`eve expansion of temporally partially coherent light fields.},

Its efficiency, simplicity, and modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has become a common option for researchers attempting to solve pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking. With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A* to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However, use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These derivative search algorithms such as {HPA}* is used to overcome the limitations of A*. {HPA}* can compete with and even surpass its competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

Thus, this articulate introductory textbook will certainly be welcomed by students and practicing professionals alike. Drawing from his vast teaching experience, the author skillfully leads the reader through a rich choice of topics in a coherent, fluid and tasteful blend of models and methods anchored on the underlying mathematical notions (only prerequisites: first year calculus and linear algebra). Topics range from the classics to some of the most recent developments in smooth unconstrained and constrained optimization, like descent methods, conjugate gradients, Newton and quasi-Newton methods, linear programming and the simplex method, trust region and interior point methods. Furthermore elements of discrete and combinatorial optimization like network optimization, integer programming and heuristic local search methods are also presented. This book presents optimization as a modeling tool that beyond supporting problem formulation plus design and implementation of efficient algorithms, also is a language suited for interdisciplinary human interaction. Readers further become aware that while the roots of mathematical optimization go back to the work of giants like Newton, Lagrange, Cauchy, Euler or Gauss, it did not become a discipline on its own until World War Two. Also that its present momentum really resulted from its symbiosis with modern computers, which made it possible to routinely solve problems with millions of variables and constraints. With his witty, entertaining, yet precise style, Michel Bierlaire captivates his readers and awakens their desire to try out the presented material in a creative mode. One of the outstanding assets of this book is the unified, clear and concise rendering of the various algorithms, which makes them easily readable and translatable into any high level programming language.

Key to our design is a high degree of multiplexing enabled by new kinds of wavelength-division-multiplexing ({WDM}) and optical circulators that support high-bandwidth bidirectional traffic on a single strand of optical fiber. The development of the requisite {OCS} and optical transceiver technologies leads to a synchronous lightwave fabric that is reconfigurable, low latency, rate agnostic, and highly available. These fabrics have provided substantial benefits for long-lived traffic patterns in our datacenter networks and predictable traffic patterns in tightly-coupled machine learning clusters. We report results for a large-scale {ML} superpod with 4096 tensor processing unit ({TPU}) V4 chips that has more than one {ExaFLOP} of computing power.

Different from the present multi-tier electrical switch network, single-tier large-port-count optical switches and their parallel configurations are shown to greatly simplify the network. Their combination offers low blocking rates and low latency even though the connection set-up is performed in a completely distributed and asynchronous manner where network wide synchronization and routing control are unneeded. The design and performance verification of our control network are detailed, and experiments on a control network emulation based on field programmable gate arrays are presented. The connection set-up latency of around 20 µs is verified within a floor (200 m) using our recently developed silicon photonic switch and tunable filter devices. The devices rely on the thermo-optic effect, but if we apply the electro-optic effect and adopt a simplified connection set-up procedure, the set-up latency is reduced to around 7 µs. The direction discussed here will pave the way for achieving bandwidth abundant and energy efficient data center networks in the future.},

In this work, we propose and demonstrate the use of a modified tree-search algorithm to automatically determine the optimum optical path in a field-programmable photonic gate array ({FPPGA}), based on end-user specifications, circuit architecture and imperfections in the realized {FPPGA} arising, for example, from fabrication variations. In such a scenario, the proposed algorithm only requires the hardware topology and the location of the connections of the {FPPGA} defining the optical path to be programmed. The routine is able to optimize the path over multiple and competing objectives like the overall length, accumulated loss and power consumption. In addition, should any region of the circuit suffer from any potential damage that may affect the device performance, this algorithm is also able to provide basic self-healing and fault-tolerance capabilities by supplying alternative paths through the photonic arrangement.},

To utilize the full potential of such circuits, special software routines need to be developed to determine the optical paths inside the mesh. Right now, current methods either scale exponentially in problem size or are severely lacking performance-wise, largely unable to find solutions, especially in recirculating waveguide meshes with square or hexagonal unit cells. We present an algorithm that computes an efficient configuration that correctly routes all given signals. Whereas similar papers look at meshes containing 7 to 20 hexagonal cells, in this article, meshes of up to hundreds of hexagonal cells are considered. We compare the results of our algorithm to an earlier proposed algorithm and to an optimal solution. Several parameters are introduced in the algorithm. These are studied and an optimizer is implemented to determine effective values for them.},

In this paper we demonstrate a non-blocking six-port optical switch for cluster-mesh photonic network-on-chip. The architecture is constructed by substituting three optical switching units of typical Spanke-Benes network to optical waveguide crossings. Compared with Spanke-Benes network, the number of optical switching units is reduced by 20\%, while the connectivity of routing path is maintained. By this way the footprint and power consumption can be reduced at the expense of sacrificing the network latency performance in some cases. The device is realized by 12 thermally tuned silicon Mach-Zehnder optical switching units. Its theoretical spectral responses are evaluated by establishing a numerical model. The experimental spectral responses are also characterized, which indicates that the optical signal-to-noise ratios of the optical switch are larger than 13.5 {dB} in the wavelength range from 1525 nm to 1565 nm. Data transmission experiment with the data rate of 32 Gbps is implemented for each optical link.},

A key enabler for these improvements is evolving Jupiter from a Clos to a direct-connect topology among the machine aggregation blocks. Critical architectural changes for this include: A datacenter interconnection layer employing Micro-{ElectroMechanical} Systems ({MEMS}) based Optical Circuit Switches ({OCSes}) to enable dynamic topology reconfiguration, centralized Software-Defined Networking ({SDN}) control for traffic engineering, and automated network operations for incremental capacity delivery and topology engineering. We show that the combination of traffic and topology engineering on direct-connect fabrics achieves similar throughput as Clos fabrics for our production traffic patterns. We also optimize for path lengths: 60\% of the traffic takes direct path from source to destination aggregation blocks, while the remaining transits one additional block, achieving an average blocklevel path length of 1.4 in our fleet today. {OCS} also achieves 3x faster fabric reconfiguration compared to pre-evolution Clos fabrics that used a patch panel based interconnect.},

We then delve into the requirements of {OCSes} for datacenter applications: balancing cost, port count, switching time, and optical performance, which drive design choices and implementation details of our internally developed 3D {MEMS}-based {OCS}. To enable the Apollo optical switching layer, we employ circulators to realize bidirectional links through the {OCS}, effectively doubling the {OCS} radix. The {OCS} and circulator design choices were critical for meeting network bandwidth, scale, and cost targets. We review the critical co-design of {WDM} transceiver technology for these {OCS} plus circulator-based bidirectional links and their corresponding physical impairments, delivered over four generations/speeds of optical interconnect.

Linear system theory is the foundation for analyzing signals in the time and frequency domains, and is reviewed first for both continuous and discrete signals. Then, we introduce the following three major filter classes: moving average ({MA}), autoregressive ({AR}) and autoregressive moving average ({ARMA}) filters. The filter magnitude, group delay and dispersion are given in terms of the Z-transform description. Single-stage optical filters are introduced next along with their Z-transform descriptions. Then, we turn out attention to multi-stage filters, which are required to closely approximate a desired magnitude or phase response. Examples of digital filter design techniques are given for each filter class, and an overview of multi-stage digital filter architectures is presented.},

	abstract = {Optical beam-forming networks ({OBFNs}) based on optical true-time delay lines ({OTTDLs}) are well known as the promising candidate for solving the bandwidth limitation of traditional electronic phased array antennas ({PAAs}) due to beam squinting. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first monolithic 1×8 microwave photonic beamformer, based on switchable {OTTDLs} on the silicon-on-insulator platform. The chip consists of a modulator, an eight-channel {OBFN}, and eight photodetectors, thus including hundreds of active and passive components in total. It has a wide operating bandwidth from 8 to 18 {GHz}, which is almost two orders larger than that of electronic {PAAs}. The beam can be steered to 31 distinguishable angles in the range from −75.51∘ to 75.64°, based on the beam pattern calculation with the measured radiofrequency response. The response time for beam steering is 56 µs. These results represent a significant step toward the realization of integrated microwave photonic beamformers that can satisfy compact-size and low-power consumption requirements for the future radar and wireless communication systems.},

	abstract = {Topological photonics is a rapidly emerging field of research in which geometrical and topological ideas are exploited to design and control the behavior of light. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit {QED}. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

	abstract = {Photonic topological insulators offer the possibility to eliminate backscattering losses and improve the efficiency of optical communication systems. Despite considerable efforts, a direct experimental demonstration of theoretically predicted robust, lossless energy transport in topological insulators operating at near-infrared frequencies is still missing. Here, we combine the properties of a planar silicon photonic crystal and the concept of topological protection to design, fabricate and characterize an optical topological insulator that exhibits the valley Hall effect. We show that the transmittances are the same for light propagation along a straight topological interface and one with four sharp turns. This result quantitatively demonstrates the suppression of backscattering due to the non-trivial topology of the structure. The photonic-crystal-based approach offers significant advantages compared with other realizations of photonic topological insulators, such as lower propagation losses, the presence of a band gap for light propagating in the crystal-slab plane, a larger operating bandwidth, a much smaller footprint, compatibility with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor fabrication technology, and the fact that it allows for operation at telecommunications wavelengths.},

Four topological boundary states emerge at the corners of the tetrahedron with a 1/4 fractional charge at each corner.

	abstract = {With the proliferation of ultrahigh-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence ({AI})1, the world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data that need to be processed in a fast and efficient way. Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important2. Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (1012 {MAC} operations per second or tera-{MACs} per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit ({ASIC}). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates3–5, ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides6,7, and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor ({CMOS}) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy {AI} applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks with applications from computer vision to medical diagnosis1–5 are commonly implemented using clock-based processors6–14, in which computation speed is mainly limited by the clock frequency and the memory access time. In the optical domain, despite advances in photonic computation15–17, the lack of scalable on-chip optical non-linearity and the loss of photonic devices limit the scalability of optical deep networks. Here we report an integrated end-to-end photonic deep neural network ({PDNN}) that performs sub-nanosecond image classification through direct processing of the optical waves impinging on the on-chip pixel array as they propagate through layers of neurons. In each neuron, linear computation is performed optically and the non-linear activation function is realized opto-electronically, allowing a classification time of under 570 ps, which is comparable with a single clock cycle of state-of-the-art digital platforms. A uniformly distributed supply light provides the same per-neuron optical output range, allowing scalability to large-scale {PDNNs}. Two-class and four-class classification of handwritten letters with accuracies higher than 93.8\% and 89.8\%, respectively, is demonstrated. Direct, clock-less processing of optical data eliminates analogue-to-digital conversion and the requirement for a large memory module, allowing faster and more energy efficient neural networks for the next generations of deep learning systems.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art patch-based image representations involve a pooling operation that aggregates statistics computed from local descriptors. Standard pooling operations include sum- and max-pooling. Sum-pooling lacks discriminability because the resulting representation is strongly influenced by frequent yet often uninformative descriptors, but only weakly influenced by rare yet potentially highly-informative ones. Max-pooling equalizes the influence of frequent and rare descriptors but is only applicable to representations that rely on count statistics, such as the bag-of-visual-words ({BOV})and its soft- and sparse-coding extensions. We propose a novel pooling mechanism that achieves the same effect as max-pooling but is applicable beyond the {BOV} and especially to the state-of-the-art Fisher Vector – hence the name Generalized Max Pooling ({GMP}). It involves equalizing the similarity between each patch and the pooled representation, which is shown to be equivalent to re-weighting the per-patch statistics. We show on five public image classification benchmarks that the proposed {GMP} can lead to significant performance gains with respect to heuristic alternatives.},

	abstract = {Conventional optical instruments make use of light that is transmitted between different locations in the form of beams that are collimated, relayed, focused, or scanned by mirrors, lenses, and prisms. Optical beams diffract and broaden, but they can be refocused by the use of lenses and mirrors. Although such beams are easily obstructed or scattered by various objects, this form of free-space transmission of light is the basis of most optical systems. There is, however, a relatively new technology for transmitting light through dielectric conduits, guided-wave optics. It has been developed to provide long-distance light transmission without the use of relay lenses. Guided-wave optics has important applications in directing light to awkward places, in establishing secure communications, and in the fabrication of miniaturized optical and optoelectronic devices requiring the confinement of light. The basic concept of optical confinement is quite simple. Integrated optics is the technology of integrating various optical devices and components for the generation, focusing, splitting, combining, isolation, polarization, coupling, switching, modulation and detection of light, all on a single substrate (chip). The basic theory of optical waveguides is presented here. This chapter deals with rectangular waveguides which are used extensively in integrated optics. Cylindrical waveguides, which are used to make optical fibers, integrated-optic devices (such as semiconductor lasers and detectors, modulators, and switches) are considered. Fiber-optic communication systems are discussed in other chapters.},

To keep the excess loss of the entire switch low, it is crucial to develop ultralow-loss 2 × 2 optical switches by introducing new coupler designs. In this paper, a low-loss calibration-free 2 × 2 Mach-Zehnder switch ({MZS}) designed with varied-width multimode-interference ({MMI}) couplers is proposed and fabricated. In this design, the {MMI} coupler has a varied-width {MMI} region and two multimode output waveguides. The {MMI} coupler optimized by the particle swarm optimization ({PSO}) algorithm has an ultralow excess loss {\textless} 0.053 {dB} and a suppressed higher-order mode excitation {\textless} −26 {dB} across the Cband (1530–1565 nm). Such a varied-width {MMI} coupler with two multimode output waveguides can be used compatibly for the {MZS} with widened phase shifters, so that the random phase imbalance between the two {MZS} arms can be suppressed effectively, which thus is promising for calibration-free operation. For the present {MZS} fabricated with standard 180-nm silicon photonic foundry processes, the excess loss is ∼0.5 {dB} across the C-band and the extinction ratio is ∼25 {dB} without calibration.},

	abstract = {The on-chip optical power splitter is a common and important device in photonic integrated circuits ({PICs}). To achieve a low insertion loss and high uniformity while splitting the guided light, multi-mode interferometer-based structures utilizing a self-imaging principle are widely used mainly in the form of a 1 × 2 configuration. Recently, an inverse design method for nanophotonic devices has emerged to overcome the limited capability of the conventional design methods and make it possible to explore the vast number of design parameters. Because of the non-intuitive shape of inverse-designed structures, they allow us to discover interesting and complex optical responses which are almost impossible to find with conventional design methods. Here, we report two kinds of inverse-designed 1 × 4 optical power splitters composed of silicon bars of different lengths, which are fabricated with a standard {CMOS}-compatible process. The particle swarm optimization method was used to minimize the insertion loss and divide the power evenly into each output port with finite-difference time-domain method simulation. The first optical power splitter has a compact size of 8.14 × 12 μm 2 and the second optical power splitter has an even more compact size of 6.0 × 7.2 μm 2 . With the inverse designed structures, we fabricated the chip with a {CMOS}-compatible fabrication process. Experimental verification of the structures is provided and good agreement with the numerical results is obtained. The first 1 × 4 optical power splitter has a low insertion loss of less than 0.76 {dB} and uniformity of less than 0.84 {dB}, and the second more compact optical power splitter has a low insertion loss of less than 1.08 {dB} and uniformity of less than 0.81 {dB}. As the complexity of on-chip photonic systems has steadily increased, the inverse design of photonic structures holds great potential to be an essential part of advanced design tools.},

We explore a relatively new photonic material, {AlScN}, for its use in electro-optic phase shifting and modulation. Its {CMOS}-compatibility could facilitate large-scale production of integrated photonic modulators, and it exhibits an enhanced second-order optical nonlinearity compared to intrinsic {AlN}, indicating the possibility for efficient modulation. Here, we measure the electro-optic effect in Al 0.80 Sc 0.20 N-based phase shifters. We utilized the {TM}0 mode, allowing use of the r 33 electro-optic coefficient, and demonstrated V π L around 750 V cm. Since the electro-optic response is smaller than expected, we discuss potential causes for the reduced response and future outlook for {AlScN}-based photonics.},

	abstract = {Silicon photonics has emerged as a mature technology that is expected to play a key role in critical emerging applications, including very high data rate optical communications, distance sensing for autonomous vehicles, photonic-accelerated computing, and quantum information processing. The success of silicon photonics has been enabled by the unique combination of performance, high yield, and high-volume capacity that can only be achieved by standardizing manufacturing technology. Today, standardized silicon photonics technology platforms implemented by foundries provide access to optimized library components, including low-loss optical routing, fast modulation, continuous tuning, high-speed germanium photodiodes, and high-efficiency optical and electrical interfaces. However, silicon’s relatively weak electro-optic effects result in modulators with a significant footprint and thermo-optic tuning devices that require high power consumption, which are substantial impediments for very large-scale integration in silicon photonics. Microelectromechanical systems ({MEMS}) technology can enhance silicon photonics with building blocks that are compact, low-loss, broadband, fast and require very low power consumption. Here, we introduce a silicon photonic {MEMS} platform consisting of high-performance nano-opto-electromechanical devices fully integrated alongside standard silicon photonics foundry components, with wafer-level sealing for long-term reliability, flip-chip bonding to redistribution interposers, and fibre-array attachment for high port count optical and electrical interfacing. Our experimental demonstration of fundamental silicon photonic {MEMS} circuit elements, including power couplers, phase shifters and wavelength-division multiplexing devices using standardized technology lifts previous impediments to enable scaling to very large photonic integrated circuits for applications in telecommunications, neuromorphic computing, sensing, programmable photonics, and quantum computing.},

We present optimized electronic switch activation, which yields a sixfold reduction in energy consumption and we show how static power consumption becomes a negligible factor for optical pulse switching. We demonstrate that with adjusted phase shifter dimensions, {MZI}-based switches can operate with additional 50\% enhanced energy efficiency with down to 4 {pJ} per switching operation. We show even further efficiency improvement using ring-based designs, allowing an additional improvement of 50\% in energy efficiency and we discuss the trade-off between efficiency and optical bandwidth associated to the Q-factor. We benchmark carrier-injection-based switches together with comparable technologies of the silicon photonics platform and identify carrier-injection to be the most suitable technology for pulse switching applications.},

	abstract = {Light propagates in the form of waves. The wave theory of light encompasses the ray theory. Strictly speaking, ray optics is the limit of wave optics when the wavelength is infinitesimally short. However, the wavelength need not actually be equal to zero for the ray-optics theory to be useful. As long as the light waves propagate through and around objects whose dimensions are much greater than the wavelength, the ray theory suffices for describing most phenomena. Because the wavelength of visible light is much shorter than the dimensions of the visible objects encountered in our daily lives, manifestations of the wave nature of light are not apparent without careful observation. In this chapter, light is described by a scalar function, called the wavefunction, which obeys the wave equation. The precise physical meaning of the wavefunction is not specified; it suffices to say at this point that it may represent any of the components of the electric or magnetic fields. This, and a relation between the optical power density and the wavefunction, constitute the postulates of the scalar wave model of light, hereafter called wave optics. The consequences of these simple postulates are many and far reaching. Wave optics constitutes a basis for describing a host of optical phenomena that fall outside the confines of ray optics, including interference and diffraction, as demonstrated here. Wave optics has its limitations. It is not capable of providing a complete picture of the reflection and refraction of light at the boundaries between dielectric materials, nor of explaining those optical phenomena that require a vector formulation, such as polarization effects. This chapter begins with the postulates of wave optics. Monochromatic waves and polychromatic light are discussed. Elementary waves, such as the plane wave and the spherical wave, are introduced. We establish that ray optics can be derived from wave optics. The transmission of optical waves through simple optical components such as mirrors, prisms, lenses, and gratings is examined. Interference, an important manifestation of the wave nature of light, is the subject the last portion of this chapter.},

However, it has been a challenge to provide photonic integrated circuits with equal levels of function flexibility as compared with their electronic counterparts. Here, we introduce a disruptive approach to tackle this need, which is analogous to an electronic field-programmable gate array. We use a grid of tunable Mach\&\#x2013;Zehnder couplers interconnected in a two-dimensional mesh network, each working as a photonic processing unit. Such a device is able to be programmed into many different circuit topologies and thereby provide a diversity of functions. This paper provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first ever demonstration of this concept and shows that a programmable chip with a free spectral range of 14\&\#{xA}0;{GHz} enables {RF} filters featuring continuous, over-two-octave frequency coverage, i.e., 1.6\&\#x2013;6\&\#{xA}0;{GHz}, and variable passband shaping ranging from a 55\&\#{xA}0;{dB} extinction notch filter to a 1.6\&\#{xA}0;{GHz} bandwidth flat-top filter.},

Owing to an increase in the scale of silicon photonics chips, the time required to calibrate various {CPSs} has increased. We propose a pairwise scan method for rapidly calibrating {CPSs} by introducing equivalent Mach Zehnder Interferometer structures and a reasonable constraint of the initial relative phase. The calibration can be nearly completed when the scanning process is finished, and only a little calculation is required. To achieve better performance, the key components, thermal optical phase shifter and 2 × 2 50/50 multimode interference coupler, were simulated and optimized to prevent thermal crosstalk and ensure a good balance. A 6-{CPSs} structure in a packaged silicon photonics chip under different temperature was used to verify the rapid pairwise scan method, and a fidelity of 99.97\% was achieved.},

	abstract = {We propose graph representations for reconfigurable photonic mesh circuits. Waveguide mesh circuits are abstracted into a graph to highlight the connectivity and topology. We model the optical ports as graph nodes. Performance metrics for each connection are incorporated into the edge attributes in categories such as propagation loss, crosstalk penalty, power consumption, phase accumulation, and so on. We use three types of graph representations for tunable couplers to model the flow of light and create a circuit graph representation to an example hexagonal mesh. The representation should respect the physics of waveguide circuits (e.g. directional flow of light). Of the three types, the directed graph with eight artificial nodes performs best for solving light distributions with feedback paths. This graph representation is demonstrated in four distribution cases: a single pair input-output, multi-pair inputs and outputs without collisions, a single input to multiple outputs (distribution), and multiple distributions without collisions. The programming tolerance against malfunctioning tunable elements is also demonstrated. With this circuit representation, we can reduce all these distribution cases to different graph problems and leverage a wealth of existing algorithms developed in graph theory to program the photonic mesh. Thus we provide a systematical strategy to design and program complex reconfigurable photonic circuits, especially in photonic meshes with feedback paths.},

While his colleagues went on to other research, Shockley grew increasingly obsessed with the new gadget. Eventually he formed his own firm - the first semiconductor company in what would become Silicon Valley, spawning hundreds of other businesses and a multi-billion-dollar industry.

In subsequent decades, the importance of detecting incoming bombers motivated the advancement of radio detection and ranging (radar) systems where the roundtrip time of a short pulse was used to find the target distance whereas the direction of the antenna was used to localize the target. Later advancements in phased array technology replaced the mechanically scanned antenna with electronically scanned versions enabling faster target localization, and ultimately, tracking multiple concurrent targets. Light detection and ranging (Iidar), initially referred to as laser radar, was developed shortly after the invention of lasers in the 1960{\textbackslash}mathrms. The primary early applications were in metrology, military, and scientific discoveries and research.

	abstract = {Silicon photonic resonators, implemented using silicon-on-insulator substrates, are promising for numerous applications. The most commonly studied resonators are ring/racetrack resonators. We have fabricated these and other resonators including disk resonators, waveguide-grating resonators, ring resonator reflectors, contra-directional grating-coupler ring resonators, and racetrack-based multiplexer/demultiplexers. While numerous resonators have been demonstrated for sensing purposes, it remains unclear as to which structures provide the highest sensitivity and best limit of detection; for example, disc resonators and slot-waveguide-based ring resonators have been conjectured to provide an improved limit of detection. Here, we compare various resonators in terms of sensor metrics for label-free bio-sensing in a micro-fluidic environment. We have integrated resonator arrays with {PDMS} micro-fluidics for real-time detection of biomolecules in experiments such as antigen-antibody binding reaction experiments using Human Factor {IX} proteins. Numerous resonators are fabricated on the same wafer and experimentally compared. We identify that, while evanescent-field sensors all operate on the principle that the analyte's refractive index shifts the resonant frequency, there are important differences between implementations that lie in the relationship between the optical field overlap with the analyte and the relative contributions of the various loss mechanisms. The chips were fabricated in the context of the {CMC}-{UBC} Silicon Nanophotonics Fabrication course and workshop. This yearlong, design-based, graduate training program is offered to students from across Canada and, over the last four years, has attracted participants from nearly every Canadian university involved in photonics research. The course takes students through a full design cycle of a photonic circuit, including theory, modelling, design, and experimentation.},

However, effective techniques for high-speed modulation of quantum states in standard silicon photonic platforms have been limited. Here we overcome this limitation and demonstrate high-speed low-error quantum key distribution modulation with silicon photonic devices combining slow thermo-optic {DC} biases and fast (10 {GHz} bandwidth) carrier-depletion modulation.

	abstract = {Quantum information science offers inherently more powerful methods for communication, computation, and precision measurement that take advantage of quantum superposition and entanglement. In recent years, theoretical and experimental advances in quantum computing and simulation with photons have spurred great interest in developing large photonic entangled states that challenge today’s classical computers. As experiments have increased in complexity, there has been an increasing need to transition bulk optics experiments to integrated photonics platforms to control more spatial modes with higher fidelity and phase stability. The silicon-on-insulator ({SOI}) nanophotonics platform offers new possibilities for quantum optics, including the integration of bright, nonclassical light sources, based on the large third-order nonlinearity (χ (3) ) of silicon, alongside quantum state manipulation circuits with thousands of optical elements, all on a single phase-stable chip. How large do these photonic systems need to be? Recent theoretical work on Boson Sampling suggests that even the problem of sampling from e30 identical photons, having passed through an interferometer of hundreds of modes, becomes challenging for classical computers. While experiments of this size are still challenging, the {SOI} platform has the required component density to enable low-loss and programmable interferometers for manipulating hundreds of spatial modes. Here, we discuss the {SOI} nanophotonics platform for quantum photonic circuits with hundreds-to-thousands of optical elements and the associated challenges. We compare {SOI} to competing technologies in terms of requirements for quantum optical systems. We review recent results on large-scale quantum state evolution circuits and strategies for realizing high-fidelity heralded gates with imperfect, practical systems. Next, we review recent results on silicon photonics-based photon-pair sources and device architectures, and we discuss a path towards large-scale source integration. Finally, we review monolithic integration strategies for single-photon detectors and their essential role in on-chip feed forward operations.},

Photonics is demonstrated to enable a new generation of miniaturized, heterogeneous, and distributed radars, i.e., future radars on chip with different features, working in different radio spectral regions, and organized in spatially distributed sensors for the enhanced detection of a wider range of target properties. In these systems, the use of photonics assures benefits in terms of frequency flexibility, accuracy, and computational load reduction. Innovative capabilities supported by the photonic approach are presented, such as the use of coherent sparse bands for the synthesis of ultrawide bands, the use of distributed sensors for multiple-input multiple-output detections, and the use of an ultrawide band photonics-based receiver for radio frequency spectrum scanning. The presented novel concepts will open the way to new research activities both in photonic technology and radar systems, contributing to the development of a new generation of remote sensing systems.

	abstract = {Many breakthroughs in the laboratories often do not bridge the gap between research and commercialization. However, silicon photonics bucked the trend, with industry observers estimating the commercial market to close in on a billion dollars in 2020 [45]. Silicon photonics leverages the billions of dollars and decades of research poured into silicon semiconductor device processing to enable high yield, robust processing, and most of all, low cost. Silicon is also a good optical material, with transparency in the commercially important infrared wavelength bands, and is a suitable platform for large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Silicon photonics is therefore slated to address the world's ever-increasing needs for bandwidth. It is part of an emerging ecosystem which includes designers, foundries, and integrators. In this paper, we review most of the foundries that presently enable silicon photonics integrated circuits fabrication. Some of these are pilot lines of major research institutes, and others are fully commercial pure-play foundries. Since silicon photonics has been commercially active for some years, foundries have released process design kits ({PDK}) that contain a standard device library. These libraries represent optimized and well-tested photonic elements, whose performance reflects the stability and maturity of the integration platforms. We will document the early works in silicon photonics, as well as its commercial status. We will provide a comprehensive review of the development of silicon photonics and the foundry services which enable the productization, including various efforts to develop and release {PDK} devices. In this context, we will report the long-standing efforts and contributions that previously {IME}/A*{STAR} and now {AMF} has dedicated to accelerating this journey.},

One system that is widely used today uses a light source with a wavelength in the 905 nm band for the pulse Light Detection And Ranging ({LiDAR}) system. This has the disadvantages of being harmful to the human eye and in making digital signal processing difficult at high sampling rates. The Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave ({FMCW}) {LiDAR} system has been proposed as an alternative. However, the {FMCW} {LiDAR} is formed with a high beat frequency by a method different from that of the {FMCW} Radar, which causes a hardware burden on the {FFT} (Fast Fourier Transform) module for interpreting the beat frequency information. In this paper, the {FFT} module that may occur in the {FMCW} {LiDAR} using Digital Down Convert ({DDC}) technology is extracted at 256 points, which is 25 times smaller than the existing 8192 points, and the beat frequency is 0 to 50 m at 3 cm intervals. As a result of generating and restoring the distance, the performance of 0.03 m Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) compared to the conventional one was confirmed. In this process, the hardware module was directly mounted and verified on the {FPGA}. In the case of the Simple Threshold-Constant False Alarm Rate ({ST}-{CFAR}) provided, the {RMSE} was measured by generating beat frequencies from 0 to 50 m at 1 cm intervals, and as a result, the result of 0.019 m was confirmed at 0.03 m in the past.},

	abstract = {The recent explosive compute growth, mainly fueled by the boost of artificial intelligence ({AI}) and deep neural networks ({DNNs}), is currently instigating the demand for a novel computing paradigm that can overcome the insurmountable barriers imposed by conventional electronic computing architectures. Photonic neural networks ({PNNs}) implemented on silicon integration platforms stand out as a promising candidate to endow neural network ({NN}) hardware, offering the potential for energy efficient and ultra-fast computations through the utilization of the unique primitives of photonics, i.e., energy efficiency, {THz} bandwidth, and low-latency. Thus far, several demonstrations have revealed the huge potential of {PNNs} in performing both linear and non-linear {NN} operations at unparalleled speed and energy consumption metrics. Transforming this potential into a tangible reality for deep learning ({DL}) applications requires, however, a deep understanding of the basic {PNN} principles, requirements, and challenges across all constituent architectural, technological, and training aspects. In this Tutorial, we, initially, review the principles of {DNNs} along with their fundamental building blocks, analyzing also the key mathematical operations needed for their computation in photonic hardware. Then, we investigate, through an intuitive mathematical analysis, the interdependence of bit precision and energy efficiency in analog photonic circuitry, discussing the opportunities and challenges of {PNNs}. Followingly, a performance overview of {PNN} architectures, weight technologies, and activation functions is presented, summarizing their impact in speed, scalability, and power consumption. Finally, we provide a holistic overview of the optics-informed {NN} training framework that incorporates the physical properties of photonic building blocks into the training process in order to improve the {NN} classification accuracy and effectively elevate neuromorphic photonic hardware into high-performance {DL} computational settings.},

The chiplet architecture enables leading edge 7nm [1] {CPUs} for multiple markets, while retaining backward compatibility to complex 10 and memory subsystems in a scalable design with high reuse for improved time-to-market. A key benefit is the heterogeneous technology deployed between the {CPUs} and the 10/mixed-{signaIP}. It is well known that shrink factors in advanced nodes are much lower for analog circuitry than for digital logic and {SRAM}. By keeping the memory interfaces and {SerOes} in mature 12nm technology, costs are mitigated since those circuits see a very small shrink factor to 7nm and very little performance or power gain from advanced nodes. A low-cost 12nm 10 die ({IOD}) with the high-yielding 8 “Zen2” core, 74mm2 7nm {CPU} compute die ({CCD}) combine to provide very cost-effective performance.},

The two devices are intimately related as the multimode interference ({MMI}) is derived from the directional couplers ({DCs}). We show for the first time the continuous evolution from the two-mode coupling characteristic of {DC} to the multimode mixing and interference characteristic of {MMI}, as the {DC} is structurally transformed into the {MMI}. We also show that {DC} can be designed to have the {MMI} features of compactness and polarization-insensitivity, two traits that reflect their shared lineage. The performance of {MMI} and {DC} are compared in terms of coupling length, polarization dependence, crosstalk, excess loss, and fabrication tolerances. We show that the {DC}, as long as it is designed to have nearly the same coupling length for transverse electric and transverse magnetic, can potentially have better performance than the {MMI} in terms of crosstalk and polarization sensitivity. Such a {DC}, however, requires careful control of many design parameters, while the {MMI} design is more robust and involves fewer design variables. Finally, the effect of higher-order modes and mode filtering are also considered.},

With these properties, the devices were used to detect and quantify the biomolecules present either in a homogeneous solution that surrounds the microring waveguide (homogeneous sensing) or specifically bound on the waveguide surface (surface sensing). In the former sensing mechanism, the current devices can detect an effective index change of 10/sup -7/ refractive index units ({RIU}); in the latter, they can reach a detection limit of /spl sim/250 pg/mm/sup 2/ of biomolecular coverage on the microring surface.
