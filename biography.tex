Part of these studies were undertaken at the University of Ottawa, Canada (2015).
In 2019, he finished his master’s studies in the Europhotonics consortium, obtaining the degrees of M.Sc.
in applied physics from the University of Aix-Marseille (AMU), France, and M.
Sc.
in optics and photonics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany.
During the 2015-2019 period Mr.~Sánchez-Jácome has worked in different research laboratories in Canada, France, Germany and Italy.
From 2020 he has worked as a software and application lead at iPronics, where he has pursued an industrial Ph.D.
degree in collaboration with the Photonics Research Labs (PRL) of the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).
His current work focuses on developing advanced routines and applications for integrated software-defined photonic technologies and performing technology intelligence studies on how to bring these solutions to the market.
